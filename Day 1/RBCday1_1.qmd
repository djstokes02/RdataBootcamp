## RStudio File Types

-   Before we move on to data science programming, let's briefly discuss RStudio file types, with a focus on `quarto` documents. ...

**ðŸ“Š Task 1.2**

1)  Take two minutes to complete the following:

-   go to `File` -\> `New File` -\> `Quarto Document`
-   select `Create`
    -   an untitled quarto document with default content should appear in your editor window.
-   read the default information
    -   click the green "play" buttons and observe what happens

2)  Based on what you read, what can you do in a quarto document?

**\[Your answer goes here\]**

-   Let's return to our untitled example doc and discuss a few other features.

-   Now let's discuss a few big picture concepts...

## Data Science Workflows

-   What comes to mind when you consider what a data science workflow might entail?

ðŸ’¬ Please discuss with two others nearby.

-   Here is an example of a data science workflow, from Lee et al. (2022):

-   What do you notice about the data science process presented here? How does it align with your experience and/or thoughts about a data science workflow?

-   Data science processes...

    -   Involve data
    -   May be iterative or cyclical
    -   May involve collaboration
    -   Should be reproducible and well documented

### Workshop project

-   In this workshop, you will produce a project with the following components:

1)  A data dictionary & data summaries
    -   why you chose your dataset, what is relevant (to you or others) about the dataset and/or what interests you about the dataset
    -   the data source, data description, dimensions, variables (ranges, levels, units), potential use cases, and other important information about the data that would be helpful for yourself and others
2)  Specification of a data investigation/research question
    -   your hypotheses and/or what you expect to find
3)  Trends or models, and visualizations
    -   related to the data investigation of interest
    -   assumptions, limitations
4)  Contextual Interpretations
    -   contextual presentation of results & interpretations
    -   what's missing from the data and/or what you would add
    -   next steps
5)  What you'll take forward from this experience and/or what else you'd like to know.

*While tracking your process/data science workflow throughout, with the following key concepts in mind.*

### Reproducibility

-   Can you reproduce the results of a given data investigation? Furthermore, can you provide someone else with a roadmap for reproducing your process and results?

-   This is what we will do and in your project this will be a focus of our programming practices.

> Summary of additional project criteria: Make your process reproducible via good programming practices, including code comments.

#### Code comments

-   Code comments are a great way to facilitate reproducibility, collaboration, organization, and understanding in the data investigations programming process.

    -   NOTE: How you specify a comment may depend on the file type that you're using, but RStudio has features to help you with this.
    -   Regardless, we'll focus on code comments that can be made in the same space as executable code.

**ðŸ“Š Task 1.3**

1)  Go to the "Code" in the task bar and scroll down to the "Comment/Uncomment Lines" option.

-   In the space below, list the shortcut to comment or uncomment a line.

**\[Your answer goes here\]**

> Summary of additional project criteria: Create informative and explanatory code comments throughout your coding process.
