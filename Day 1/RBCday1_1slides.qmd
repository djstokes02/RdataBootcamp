## Course Goals & Objectives

::: panel-tabset
### Overview

This course is designed to offer a collaborative experience in data science processes using the R programming language and the RStudio platform. You will have the opportunity to work with your cohort mates on data-driven project-based programming, as you prepare for your graduate studies journey. This course is interactive and questions and comments are encouraged and highly recommended in facilitation of a meaningful experience, regardless of you prior programming skillset.

### Objectives

At the end of this bootcamp, you will be able to:

-   Develop and document data analysis plans
-   Collaborate in a team oriented setting
-   Communicate reproducible workflows and insights from a data investigation, using visualizations and machine learning techniques

## Environment

-   Let's open up RStudio
    -   NOTE: You may want to add the RStudio icon to your desktop

## The RStudio IDE

## Our focus in RStudio

-   The windows in RStudio are customizable by accessing the `Panes Layout` within `View` in the taskbar. In the default settings we will focus on the `editor` and the `console`.
-   Take two minutes to explore the various tabs in the other windows.
    -   Any ideas about what will appear in our environment?
    -   What do you imagine the `import` wizard does?

## Questions

-   What else are you wondering about the RStudio IDE?
-   Any comments or concerns?

## Organization

::: panel-tabset
### Overview

-   Organization is a fundamental part of any effective workflow, and for just about any data-driven project, there will be a need to access data and materials.
-   We'll create a common organizational structure so that we can easily access the materials we need for a given task.

Let's keep it simple and take advantage of our computer's built-in organizational system.

### ðŸ“Š Task 1.1a

In RStudio, let's create an R project:

-   go to File and New Project.
-   select "existing directory"
-   select your location of preference and name the folder `Rbootcamp`

### ðŸ“Š Task 1.1b

-   go to the [Course Materials google folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FmYRijn9TOu241Nn3uwGXqOe7g08ijB6?usp=drive_link)
-   download the `Day 1` folder
-   save the materials in your Rbootcamp folder

### ðŸ“Š Task 1.1c

-   (in RStudio) go to your `Files` tab and verify that the `Day 1` folder and files appear.
-   Find `RBCday1_1.qmd` in your Files tab and click to open
    -   NOTE: Upon opening `RBCday1_1.qmd` should appear within your editor window.

## On to RStudio

-   Now, let's transition from viewing the slide deck to working in RStudio together.
